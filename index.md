# KuangjuX

I'm KuangjuX, a undergraduate in TianJin University, strugging for postgraduate exam. My hobby range from Web development to hard core system such as OS, embedded system, distributed system. I like Rust and hope to be a system engineer.

I'm strugging for postgraduate exam, it's so boring : (
