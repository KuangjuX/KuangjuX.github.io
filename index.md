# KuangjuX

I'm KuangjuX, a undergraduate in TianJin University. My interests range from Web development to hard core system such as OS, embedded system, distributed system. I like Rust and hope to be a system engineer.

I'm strugging for postgraduate exam, it's so boring : ( For the propose of preparing for postgraduate exam, Some work and projects will be slowed or stopped, including MIT 6.824 learning and playing with raspberry pi 4.

If you want to know more about me, you can visit my [blog](https://blog.kuangjux.top) and [resume](file/resume.pdf).

## Education

- TianJin University 2019 -- 2023(Expected)

## Projects

- [xv6-rust](https://github.com/Ko-oK-OS/xv6-rust), A Unix-like operating system implemented by pure rust. This project is a reimplementation of [xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv). Besides, it do some optimizations to the origin system such as memory allocation and file system. This project also serves as the reference implementation for [oscomp proj-4](https://github.com/oscomp/proj4-xv6-rust). You can find more information abot this project in documents.

- [rCore-fat](https://github.com/KuangjuX/rCore-fat), A operating system based [rCore-Tutorial-v3](https://github.com/rcore-os/rCore-Tutorial-v3) with fat32 file system. This project is a alternative topic of [rCore-OS community](https://github.com/rcore-os) in summer 2021.

- [ChiselMIPS](https://github.com/NSCSCC-2022-TJU/ChiselMIPS), A classical 5-stage pipeline CPU written in Chisel with instruction cache and data cache.

- [Trivial-TCP](https://github.com/KuangjuX/Trivial-TCP), A TCP/IP stack implement by pure C, which use `UDP` to simulate low level. This project is the final project of Computer Network Coursera.

- [mini-game-os](https://github.com/raspberrypi-embedded/mini-game-os), A bare metal game running in raspberry pi 4 written in Rust. This  is my hobby project and is also my first try to explore embedded system in Rust. Is is a simple OS designde for playing simple game including snake game, flappy bird and so on. This project can run on QEMU and raspberry pi 4B. Now it can communication by uart and display by framebuffer. 
  
  Because of stress of exam, this project is still under construction and slowly developed. I hope to do a smol bare metal game and enjoy it!

- [ThunderVirt](https://github.com/KuangjuX/ThunderVirt), A type-1 hypervisor run on RISC -V machine, I intend to design this project as my undergraduate final project.

Some small but interesting projects:

- [tomasulo-emulator](https://github.com/KuangjuX/tomasulo-emulator), Tomasulo-emulator is an out of order execution of CPU emulator using tomasulo algorithm written in Rust. It can be used to compare performance between out of order CPU and other CPU.

- [mi-frame-player](https://github.com/KuangjuX/mi-frame-player), mi-frame-player is a simple frame player written in Vue3 and element-plus, it have only a single page and it can plays frame like vedio and draws point cloud.

You can find all of my project [here](https://github.com/KuangjuX/Undergraduate-Projects).

## Awards

- Operating System Competition in 2021 Three Prize in Team Competition

- Summer 2021 The Best Quality Award(only 5)

## Experiences
